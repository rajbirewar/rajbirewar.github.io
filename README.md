# The BIM Journey and Life Stories!

<I> "Every Moment Is A Fresh Beginning" </I>

“Do it for the piece of sky we are stealing with our building. You do it for the air that will be displaced, and most of all, you do it for the concrete. Because it is as delicate as blood!”

‘Smorgasbord of Eccentricities’ - the fond annotation I have of my family, aptly describes the reason why the domain of Construction Management was ingrained in me since my childhood. Despite being well established in their foundational fields, my father and elder brother have been consistently associated with numerous construction projects taking place across the state. Their incessant efforts to ensure successful completion of activities as per the intended schedule coerced me to establish a correlation between effective planning and execution of construction projects. In order to polish this indistinct relationship and dive deeper into the minutiae of this genre, I decided to pursue masters in Construction Management Technology at Purdue University. 

Having acquired a diverse technical knowledge through five multifaceted internships- amounting to a total of about 16 months, I am primarily associated with the domains of BIM-Driven Construction Project Management and Advanced VDC Technologies. 

Currently- I am pursuing my Master's Thesis titled: 'Generative Design for Construction Layout and Planning'. Through my association with the Computer Graphics Technology Department, I have had the opportunity to guide more than 200 students in the realm of VDC and Construction Visualization. Additionally, I serve as the BIM 360 Project Admin for all academic VDC Projects at Purdue University. 

Looking for Full Time Opportunities starting May 2021.
